# Conversational Glossary of Terms
	
An open source glossary of terms used in conversational user interface design and development. 
	
## About 
The conversational glossary was developed Voxable. We aim to advance the design and development of conversational interfaces by sharing resources with the community.  
	
We wanted a core resource of understanding that we could use with our clients and the community. We want this open source resource to be a tool for collaboration by helping to establish a core set of concepts on which the community can build. 
	
We seek to eliminate buzzwords and provide clear meanings of the emerging technology space of conversational user interfaces and design for artificial intelligence.   
	
## Guidelines
The terms were developed according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommendations on data definitions1.

A data definition shall:
a) be stated in the singular 
b) state what the concept is, not only what it is not 
c) be stated as a descriptive phrase or sentence(s) 
d) contain only commonly understood abbreviations 
e) be expressed without embedding definitions of other data or underlying concepts

4.2 Recommendations A data definition should:
a) state the essential meaning of the concept 
b) be precise and unambiguous 
c) be concise 
d) be able to stand alone 
e) be expressed without embedding rationale, functional usage, or procedural information 
f) avoid circular reasoning 
g) use the same terminology and consistent logical structure for related definitions 
h) be appropriate for the type of metadata item being defined
	
Wikipedia covers several fallacies of definition which should be avoided when defining terms in this glossary.
