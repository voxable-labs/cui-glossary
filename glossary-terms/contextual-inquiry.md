# Contextual Inquiry
noun.

Contextual inquiry is a semi-structured interview method<sup>1</sup> in which users are observed in their environment while being interviewed or asked questions about what they are doing. 

Contextual inquiry is one of the most effective ways to uncover users' experiences of a conversational interface. It allows the researchers to uncover the expectations of users who are using the application in a somewhat natural way, often in a natural environment. As the user explore the interface, they reveal their unspoken expectations. The researchers also have the opportunity to pause and inquire more deeply about the test subjectâ€™s expectations and needs while also allowing the users to navigate through the interface.
