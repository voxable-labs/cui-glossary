# Wizard-of-Oz Method 
noun.

The Wizard-of-Oz Method is a rapid prototyping technique in which subjects respond to a simulated prototype. This can be done with very low fidelity prototypes like paper prototypes as well as higher-fidelity ones built with a prototyping tool.

In conversational design, this test happens after the conversation flows have been developed.
